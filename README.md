# MyJDBC

This is my Java based learning project. The objectives of this project were:
  - learn how JDBC works;
  - learn how servlets work.
  
Stack:
  - Maven
  - Servlets
  - JSP
  - JDBC
  - MySql 8.0.13
  
About JDBC:
  I have entities Developer, Skill and Project. They have restful API and some specific methods like getting all Java developers or 
  get all developers of a particural project.
  
About servlets:
  I have cookie based authorization and role based authentication. Also I have my custom password encoder and filter.
  In web API I have pages of log in, registration, home, logout and util pages like 404(not found) and 403(access denied).
